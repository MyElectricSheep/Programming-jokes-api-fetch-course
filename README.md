# The Programming Jokes API
This is a dead simple API (whipped up with [JSON server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server)) that I created for a course on teaching the usage of APIs/Fetch with vanilla Javascript & React.

There's only one endpoint: `GET` `/jokes` which will get you some silly jokes ðŸŽ‰

A live version of the API is available [here](https://programming-jokes-api.herokuapp.com/jokes)
